# Partial VAE
<B>Implementation</B>

My code is in <a href=partial_vae.py>partial_vae.py</a>, implemented in TensorFlow 2.7.0, directly from the paper (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11142>Ma et al. 2019</a>).

The Partial VAE is trained on masked input data so as to be able to impute missing values for incomplete test data.
